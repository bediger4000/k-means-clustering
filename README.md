# K-means clustering experiment

Just a quickie to mess around with k-means clustering.

And it looks like it works.

## Build it

You need gnuplot and a Go compiler

   $ make

Should create random data and show it to you.
Uses [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)
to show you an image.
Clusters are colored, centroids of clusters are angry red dots.
